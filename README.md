Project Background

Students often benefit from having access to additional resources when studying. Having a single repository where they can find and share resources can be extremely beneficial.

 Project Goal

Your challenge is to develop a simple web-based study material repository where users can upload and download study materials. For simplicity, this platform will not require user login or advanced features like rating, reviewing, or discussion forums.

 Key Features

1. Material Submission: Allow users to submit materials in various formats such as PDFs, Word documents, images, and links to online resources (like YouTube for educational videos).
2. Material Organization: Organize materials based on a few simple categories such as subject or grade level.
3. Search Functionality: Enable users to find resources based on the name of the resource or category.

 Technical Requirements

 Front-End: React.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
 Back-End: Node.js
 Database:  MongoDB
 Deployment:  Netlify

 Development Stages

Planning Stage: Design the UI/UX of the application and decide on the technologies to be used.
Development Stage 1: Set up the server and database, and create the material submission feature.
Development Stage 2: Implement the material organization and search functionality.
Testing Stage: Perform basic tests to ensure all features work as expected.
Deployment Stage: Deploy the application on a server.
