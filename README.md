## Simple Study Repo

**Project Background:**
Students often benefit from having access to additional resources when studying. Having a single repository where they can find and share resources can be extremely beneficial.

**Project Goal:**
Develop a simple web-based study material repository where users can upload and download study materials. For simplicity, this platform will not require user login or advanced features like rating, reviewing, or discussion forums.

**Key Features:**
1. **Material Submission:** Allow users to submit materials in various formats such as PDFs, Word documents, images, and links to online resources (like YouTube for educational videos).
2. **Material Organization:** Organize materials based on a few simple categories such as subject or grade level.
3. **Search Functionality:** Enable users to find resources based on the name of the resource or category.

**Technical Requirements:**
- **Front-End:** React.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript 
- **Back-End:** Node.js 
- **Database:** MongoDB 
- **Deployment:** Netlify

**Development Stages:**
1. **Planning Stage:** Design the UI/UX of the application and decide on the technologies to be used.
2. **Development Stage 1:** Set up the server and database, and create the material submission feature.
3. **Development Stage 2:** Implement the material organization and search functionality.
4. **Testing Stage:** Perform basic tests to ensure all features work as expected.
5. **Deployment Stage:** Deploy the application on a server.
